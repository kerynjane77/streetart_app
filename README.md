##Footscray Streetart

An information app that shows street art sites in Footscray on a google map. When you click on an artist name, the map marker changes colour. There are links to the artist's websites for more information.

### Tech

Made with HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, and javaScript, the app uses Googlemaps API. I built the app locally using Sinatra. JQuery was used to change the map marker colour of the selected artwork, and to scroll to the map section. The site uses a PostgreSQL database and Active Record. New art sites can be added to the database using a form.

The index view uses embedded Ruby code to display each artist name and artwork image from the database.
